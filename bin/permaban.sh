# Permaban - v1.5
#	by Sophie Forceno
#
# Each week, make a list of IPs permanently banned by fail2ban, and email it to root@localhost
# Also send whois info for permabanned IPs, and the list of failed authentication attempts
#
# This script requires the ssh-repeater filter for fail2ban. 
# See: http://stuffphilwrites.com/2013/03/permanently-ban-repeat-offenders-fail2ban/
#
# This script works best via cron, for example:
# 58 23  * * 5     /home/user/bin/permaban
# Will send the weekly report on Fridays at 11:58pm
# It is recommended that you check to see when your auth.log is rotated
# and have cron execute this just before rotation
#
# I also recommend changing the default action in your jail.local to "action_", like so:
# action = %(action_)s
# That way you won't receive the real-time whois and auth log excerpts from fail2ban
# on top of the weekly emails from permaban
#
